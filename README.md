## Answers
1. b
2. c
3. d
4. b
5. a
6. c
7. a
8. a
9. d
10. b
11. c
12. a) Sleeping: A process is in the Sleeping state when it is waiting for some event to occur.
    b) Running: The process is currently executing on the CPU.
    c) Zombie: After a process has completed its execution, it enters the ZOMBIE state.
    d) Unused: A process in the Unused state is not in use.
    e) Runnable: A process in the RUNNABLE state is ready to run but is waiting for the CPU to be scheduled.
    f) Embryo: The process is in the Embryo state when it is being created but has not yet been fully initialized.
13. 1) Superblock: Contains essential file system information, such as size and block details.
    2) Inodes: Store metadata for files and directories, including permissions and pointers.
    3) Directory Entries: Map file names to inode numbers, organizing files hierarchically.
    4) File Allocation Table: Manages free and allocated blocks, aiding efficient storage allocation.
    5) File Descriptor Table: The file descriptor table is maintained for each process and keeps track of open files.
14. System Calls: System calls are interfaces that allow user-level processes to request services from the kernel.They involve a switch to kernel mode.
                  Example: fork() for creating a new process.
    Library Functions: Library functions are pre-compiled routines in user space that communicate with the kernel indirectly through system calls.They operate entirely in user space, not requiring a mode switch to the kernel.
                       Example: printf() for output
15. Memory Paging in XV6: In XV6, memory paging involves breaking physical memory and virtual memory into fixed-size pages. The Memory Management Unit (MMU) maps virtual pages to physical frames using a page table. When a process 
                          accesses a virtual address, the MMU translates it to a physical address through the page table.
    Benefits of Paging: Allows non-contiguous allocation of physical memory, overcoming the limitations of contiguous allocation and Enables efficient utilization of physical memory, as pages can be allocated and deallocated 
    independently. Simplifies memory management by providing a uniform, modular structure, aiding in better system organization and maintenance.
16. ls:
    Description: Lists the contents of the current directory.
    Example: ls -l displays detailed information, including permissions and sizes.
    cd:
    Description: Changes the current working directory.
    Example: cd documents navigates into the "documents" directory.
    cat:
    Description: Concatenates and displays the contents of files.
    Example: cat file.txt prints the content of "file.txt" to the console.
17. Process synchronization in XV6 is crucial for managing shared resources among concurrent processes, preventing conflicts and ensuring data consistency. Mechanisms like semaphores and locks are employed to coordinate access to 
    critical sections of code. These synchronization tools help avoid race conditions and maintain the integrity of shared data, contributing to the reliability and correctness of concurrent programs in the operating system.
18. Role: Interrupts in XV6 are signals generated by hardware or software events that interrupt the normal flow of the CPU to handle specific tasks. They play a vital role in responding to asynchronous events, such as I/O completion or 
    timer ticks.
